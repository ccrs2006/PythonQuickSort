# Python QuickSort
## Generating 1000 random numbers and then using the quick sort method to sort them

### STEP 1. 
* Setup working environment, Header Notes/README.
I used Visual Studio Code and Python as my working environnment for this project. I then created a README file in my github account to display
and showcase my steps during the project. 

### STEP 2.
* Research various sources for insights on random number array generators and put together my own version of code to manipulated the way I need it to work
I search the different options available within the random library to see which one was a better option for what I was looking to apply on my project.

### STEP 3.
* Implement a partition function which takes last element as pivot, places the pivot element at its correct position in sorted array, and places all smaller (smaller than pivot) to left of pivot and all greater elements to right of pivot.

### STEP 4.
* Create a quicksort function which leverages the partion function to place the index in the correct place for sorting

### STEP 5.
* Applied the randomNumberGen function to shuffle the list of number from 0 to 1000 that provides us with a new list of random numbers. 
I then went ahead and placed the new array into a variable which I then applied int he Driver code for the final result.

### Result
* In the result I printed the original list of random numbers in order for the user to see the result
Right after that the sorted list of these numbers displays.

### Final Comments:
The project brought its challenges begining with the implementation of the sorted array of numbers. Second, the implementation and understanding of the partition function took a while to get a grasp of but once I was tested and applied to a short list of numbers then it all made sense in the code. 
Overall, the project was fun and I learned a lot about how the quick sort works in the actual code.
